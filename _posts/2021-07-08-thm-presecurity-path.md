You'll get to learn the following;

<div style="color:#88cc14;background-color:#000f2b;padding:10px;border-radius:5px;">

  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="course-modules" name="modules"
          checked default>
    <label for="scales">Networking Fundamentals</label>

<br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="course-modules" name="modules"
          checked>
    <label for="scales">Learn How the Web Works</label>
<br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="course-modules" name="modules"
          checked>
    <label for="scales">Linux Fundamentals</label>
<br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="course-modules" name="modules"
          checked>
    <label for="scales">Windows Fundamentals</label>
  </div>

</div>


<br>


You get to learn all this in a simple, easy to understand way as the creators have created these rooms with absolute beginners in mind.

You also get visual interpretation of how things work; for instance, you can "see" how a packet (don't worry, you'll know what a packet is soon enough) travels from Point A to Point B.

You also earn badges when you complete modules within the learning path, which you can share with your friends and the world.

When you get done with the <span>**Pre Security**</span> Learning Path, move on to the next one, the <span style="color:#88cc14;">**Complete Beginner Learning Path**</span> which will build up on the Pre Security Learning Path, and continue with the other more advanced learning paths.
